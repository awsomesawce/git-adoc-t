= NOTES

Interesting things to keep in mind.

== Msys2 compatibility

NOTE: When starting `codium` from the MSYS2 prompt, you have access to
the MSYS2 PATH and programs.

When using the integrated terminal, and if you have Git for Windows
installed, opening a Git Bash shell in the integrated terminal will
make it act just like your MSYS2 shell!

=== Why does this happen

I believe it happens because it reads the bash config from
`~/.bashrc`, etc, and `$HOME` is set to the *MSYS2* home!

Pretty cool!

== Using Helix

NOTE: Helix is available from both _scoop_ and _msys2_ using it's `pacman`
package manager.
